# Array-bomb
# https://xjoi.net/contest/4733/problem/4

# Description
# In a dark and stormy night, you are given a explosion mission. Given a n*m area, where some places have a wall. 
# If you put a bomb at position (i,j), then the wall in i-th row and j-th column would all be destroyed. 
# Now you want to know whether all the walls can be destroyed using only one bomb.

# Input
# The first line is an integer T representing the number of groups of testing data.
# For each group of testing data, the first line enters two numbers n, m representing a n*m area.
# The next n lines, each line contains m characters of '*' representing the wall and '.' representing space.  1<=n,m<=1000

# Output
# In the first line, there's way to destroy all walls by only one bomb, output "YES", otherwise output "NO".
# If the answer is "YES", please output the positon of bomb x,y in the second line separated by space.

# Notice:If you have several ways to solve the problem, output the one who has the smallest row number, then, if there are 
# still several ways, output the one which has the smallest column number. 

# Sample Input
# 2
# 3 4
# .*..
# ....
# .*..

# 3 3
# ..*
# .*.
# *..

# â€‹Sample Output
# YES
# 1 2
# NO
